# ICU4C

ICU is an internationalization library supported by IBM. Home of the project
is [http://www.icu-project.org/](http://www.icu-project.org/)

# Building for PHP

To build ICU with native Microsoft tools follow the instructions in the readme.html#HowToBuildCygwin from
the source directory. Note that bash, make and several other UNIX tools are
needed. Based on experience configure and make scripts strongly require
cygwin ports of the tools. At this time a work is being done to make it possible to generate Visual Studio projects with cmake.
